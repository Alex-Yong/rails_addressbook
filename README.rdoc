This was our first full-stack Rails app. It consists of a landing page, a list of all entered contacts, an option to add, delete or edit a contact, and a separate table for phone numbers that ties in with the main table. We used pair programming and had about 4 hours to create this, along with Capybara testing. We also used MySQL for the tables.

At this point it does not have any CSS, but I hope to update the visuals and deploy it soon.
